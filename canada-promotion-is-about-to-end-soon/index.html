                                    <p>You'll spot it from far away, if you were clever enough to ask for a window seat on the plane. It's Sin City – an oasis of glittering lights in the desert, home of the Strip and the drive-in wedding chapel, and a visual spectacle complete with its own Eiffel Tower, Egyptian pyramids, and Venetian canals. Welcome to Las Vegas.</p>
                                    <p>It's a place that's defined as much by vintage camp as by futuristic innovation, where the classic steakhouses and 24-hour casinos exist alongside world-class dining, sleek hotels, and thrilling entertainment from the acrobatic stylings of Cirque du Soleil to the High Roller, a massive observation wheel. Sin City nightlife is legendary, whether you're moving to the rhythm of DJ-spun beats on a dance floor lined with gold or standing on an open-air terrace, drink in hand, taking in the sweeping views of neon-lit resorts and casinos below. This is Vegas, baby.</p>
                                    <p>Ten thousand dollars means different things to different people, especially in Las Vegas.</p>
                                    <p>For some, it’s a car to take them to work. For others, it’s a shiny piece of jewelry. In some casinos, it’s a pair of chocolate brown $5,000 chips. And in 2003 at the Hard Rock Hotel, it was the total amount of liquor sales at the resort’s sprawling pool complex on an average summer Sunday. Today, at several pools in Las Vegas, $10,000 dollars is the bare minimum a patron should be prepared to spend if he or she wants to be considered a “baller,” the highest level of partyer in the big-money world of Las Vegas dayclubs.</p>
                                    <p>An oasis of indulgence in the desert, Vegas' seduction is hypnotic.</p>
                                    <p>What about 48 hours in . . . Las Vegas?</p>
                                    <p><strong>Day one</strong></p>
                                    <p>Just arrived in Sin City? There's no better place to start than with a photo op beside a retro landmark: the "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas, Nevada" sign. If you're taking a taxi into town from the airport, you'll spot it as you enter the southern end of the Strip, just south of Mandalay Bay. You'll know where to pull over, there's always a crowd of cars and a constant flash of cameras.</p>
                                    <p>Then continue north along the Strip and enjoy the replicas of famous buildings from the car window: the Empire State Building and the Luxor pyramid on your left, and the faux Eiffel Tower on your right. Say goodbye to your taxi driver at the Bellagio and head straight for the jaw-dropping floral displays at the Bellagio Conservatory & Botanical Garden. The exhibition changes four times a year – in spring, summer, fall, and winter – with themes such as Under the Sea and Japanese Spring.</p>
                                    <p>At sunset, you'll want to be onboard the High Roller observation wheel – it's taller than the London Eye, and the 30-minute ride offers unbeatable views over the glittering Strip and the desert beyond. Afterwards, enjoy a quick viewing of the famous fountain show outside the Bellagio from the sidewalk, or from the vantage point of HYDE cocktail lounge inside the resort.</p>
                                    <p>Las Vegas is all about nightlife: Sin City’s clubs and lounges are world-famous for a reason. Generally speaking, unless you’re at a venue off the Strip, there’s an upscale, casual dress code. And while women can get away with almost anything, the rules are always enforced for men: no baseball caps, sneakers, or open-toed shoes are allowed. You’ll wait in line no matter what, but if you’re looking to book a table or splurge on bottle service, always book ahead.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Day two</strong></p>
                                    <p>Today's the day to enjoy the vintage charm of downtown Las Vegas. Start with a stroll down the neon-lit Fremont Street Experience, a pedestrian-only promenade that's a 24/7 spectacle complete with a zip line, live entertainment, and vendors selling supersized cocktails. If you'd like to learn the basics of blackjack, now's a good time to stop into one of the neighbourhood's classic casinos for a free lesson.</p>
                                    <p>Otherwise, spend a couple of hours at the mafia-themed Mob Museum. Housed in a restored former courthouse that dates from 1933, it offers a fascinating overview of the city’s history of developing casino-resorts as we know them today.</p>
                                    <p>As the sun goes down, stroll along the outdoor sections of the Neon Museum around Fremont Street, where retro signs – including vintage motel relics and a larger-than-life glittering martini glass – add a neon glow to the evening.</p>
                                    <p>There's so much to see and do in Vegas – both in and around the resorts on The Strip, and in the lively and rapidly revitalising downtown – that you'll never get through it all. Make sure to hit up at least a couple of the classic attractions and landmarks, learn something about Vegas history at the Neon Museum or the Mob Museum, and try your hand at the game machines or casino table at least once.</p>
